Are you tired of typing out long, complicated bash commands? Do you wish there was a way to automate your workflow and make your life easier? Look no further than Bash AI! 🚀

Bash AI is a command-line tool that uses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 to provide intelligent suggestions and automation for your bash commands. 🤖 Simply type `??` followed by your command, and Bash AI will analyze it and provide suggestions for how to complete or automate it.

For example, if you want to create a new file called `app.log`, just type:
```bash
?? create new file app.log
```
Bash AI will suggest the command `$ touch app.log`, and you can choose whether to run it in your terminal or not. 🤔

But before you can start using Bash AI, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Just export it like this:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

And that's it! With Bash AI, you can streamline your workflow, save time, and make your life easier. Try it out today! 👍
